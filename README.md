# React random quote generator

The app utilizes an open-source API from quotable.io to generate random quotes for a daily dose of wisdom. 
When the applicaton is first loaded it gives a random quote from the database together with the random base color from the colorhunt palettes. The max length of the quotes is limited.

The 'Get a quote' button is fetching a new quote together with a new background color. 

I have used bootstrap and react-icons for some styling and SASS to practice libraries and extensions.
